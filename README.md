# Giphy | Angular 2

### Purpose
The purpose of developing this application is gain experience with Angular 2.

### Functionality
The application allows users to request content from giphy.

### Use
* `git clone https://github.com/emilycritter/giphy-angular.git`

* search for gifs!

*Note: Prior to experimenting with Angular 2, I did not have experience building applications with NodeJS. For this application I used the Angular 2 "out of the box" setup from https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. I intend to enhance this application after I spend some time experimenting with NodeJS
