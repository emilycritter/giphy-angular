*Note: Prior to experimenting with Angular 2, I did not have experience building applications with NodeJS. For this application I used the Angular 2 "out of the box" setup from https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html. I intend to enhance this application after I spend some time experimenting with NodeJS
